## üß† Learning Experiences
Building StarMap<‚≠êÔ∏è> has been a journey through the stars‚Äîliterally and figuratively. Here are a few things we learned along the way:

1. **Integrating OAuth2**: Implementing OAuth2 for Google and GitHub taught us the intricacies of secure authentication, while ensuring a smooth user experience.
2. **Handling NASA‚Äôs APOD API**: Fetching and managing external data from the APOD API required fine-tuning to the backend for reliability (custom deserializers coming!).
3. **Spring Security and Custom Authentication**: Combining traditional form-based login with OAuth2 was a challenge, but it also taught us the importance of flexible security configurations.
4. **Spring Modulith**: As we prepare to modularize StarMap<‚≠êÔ∏è>, we're excited to dive into Spring Modulith, event buses, and improving transactional boundaries with a Domain Driven Design. The goal? A more maintainable, scalable, and responsive application.

## üåü Additional Features in the Works
- **Spring Modulith**: We‚Äôre working on modularizing the app to improve scalability and maintainability.
- **Event Buses**: Integrating event-driven architecture for better decoupling and responsiveness.
- **Improved Transactional Boundaries**: Enhancing the transactional management to ensure data integrity and performance.

    - Create an `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory, or use the provided `.env` file for environment-specific configurations.
    - Add your NASA API key and OAuth2 client credentials:
      ```properties
      spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=your-google-client-id
      spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=your-google-client-secret
      spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-id=your-github-client-id
      spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-secret=your-github-client-secret
      nasa.api.key=your-nasa-api-key
      ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    - Use Maven to build and run the application:
      ```bash
      mvn clean install
      mvn spring-boot:run
